# OOP-Game: City-Builder (CS-224-Spring-2020)

Be the game changer of your very own city as you design and create a sustainable metropolis in this world defaced by global warming.

## Abstract

Amidst the global crisis of climate change, there is little to no chance of having
a sustainable future for the upcoming generations. A model presented in the scientific american 
suggests that the earth would cross the climate change threshold by 2036 which could harm
the human civilization. Furthermore, fossil feul usage in mainstream industry is a major cause of
global warming, a phenomenon of increase in earth's temperature. How do we respond to such a situation?. 
The initial steps would be stake holder identification. Research shows that the majority of climate 
harming activities are caused by people, may it be waste management, air pollution, or melting of ice
caps in the arctic. We propose a climate change model based game that penetrates the youth of society
and delivers a strong and essential message in a fun, entertaining, and interactive manner. The game 
will be based Turn-based strategy (TBS), allowing the user to decide whether to take certain decisions
 based on the consequences of climate change. The game would promote, highlight, and provide detailed 
 information comparing sustainable energy sources over traditional feuls.
 
## Overview

The game features a Turn Based Strategy (TBS) where a player
is given responsibility to build and create a city from ground up. 
The game begins with destruction upon the people of Karachi. Millions 
of people have died due to spead of diseases due to industrial emissions
and pollution. The main players now look for someone, who reinvents the idea
of economy. The player is given responsibility to build a sustainable envoirnment
keeping in consideration general pollutants and environmental hazards. 

# Main Concept
The main concept behind the game 
 is to create awareness of the ongoing climate change crisis
 happening around the globe. The game specifically targets the
 energy sector of industry and impliments an efficient and practical
 green energy model for sustainable energy in industry. 
 
## Unique selling point

After conducting a rigorous research regarding the work done related to the idea, we found significant amount
of work done by organisations such as NASA (https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/play/). No game however, was able 
 to provide a holistic experience to the user and highlight the problem at the same time. Althought there are highly developed
 developments such as SimCity, they lack on inculcating the idea of climate change as a major feature of the game. 
Our development, concerned with green and sustainable energy consumption is aimed to deliver an overall experience to the 
problem of climate change.  

## Specifications
Following is the brief description of the specification of the game i.e. the description of target group, platform, art style, and forms of engagement.

### Player(s) / Target-group

The game will be specifically designed for the youth, who are the leaders for tomorrow, the motivation behind this target audience is that in order to mitigate the impact of the climate change we need the youth of the world on the same page. Our propose is to highlight through our game the probable future we are about to face because of climate change / global warming and implicitly instill in our audience an awareness regarding it.

### Genre 
The genre of the game is Turn-based strategy (TBS).

## Story
In this game, the player develops a city from a patch of undeveloped land or even worse condition. We would try to give controls to the player to place different things and or manage them. The city would be populated by simulated persons, who live in the city created by the player. The main development zone would be industrial for example factories, warehouses, laboratories and farms.

### Main objective

The main aim of our game would be to create awareness about how much we have done to our environment and now if we get another chance to make all things right, then what steps will we take in order to fix these major problems of climate change and global warming.

## Development systems/Tools
The development is mainly based on the following :

System     | technology
-------- | ---
Programming Language | c++ 
Graphics Handling    | SDL_2 
Serialization    | Boost/archive
Music and text        | SDL extended libraries
